How make button float on input field
Solution 1:
make container relative
make insider absolute
ok let's do it


>> Rule: make it just work and fast, methodically

Nhin vao day ta rut ra cai gi?

Step first: write css selector, put class that very fast, then experiment with all of it
Step second: find the similar, the same, the common share of all the pieces of code. Collect them in a share selector

Do the first step fast first, then step second is posible!
One: Fast >> Two: Shorter
Three: Smarter >> Four: Complex

Want fast as possible:
- if it has a few elements: put only name unique
- if it has multi elements with same specify, role. Put the parent nearest (in a same field)
>> that is all!

Which couldn't do?? Give it up, fuck it! Programming!


Different between ID and CLASS:
ID is uniqe
>> ID choose js, selector FASTER than class
ID higher prio than class in css cascade
ID easyly work with Javascript
